He talked about the importance of cyber-physical security and guided us through a hands-on lab with Armis&amp;rsquo; flagship SIEM, tracing exploit attempts and hidden devices on the demo network. It was super valuable and everyone really enjoyed getting to hear this unique industry perspective! We had 28 students come out and participate, and great informal conversations afterward!</description></item><item><title>WWT Blue Team CyberRange</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/wwt-blue-team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 17:24:37 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/wwt-blue-team/</guid><description>Last Thursday, OSUSEC assembled a team of 4 students to compete in WWT&amp;rsquo;s fantastic blue team CyberRange!
