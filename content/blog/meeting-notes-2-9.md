Thank you to everyone who attended tonight’s meeting! We chatted some more about reverse engineering, discussing the stack layout, function preambles and local variables on the stack. We introduced the `rev02` challenge on the CTF Practice Range at [https://ctf.osusec.org](https://ctf.osusec.org).

The slides for the meeting are available here (ONID Login Required): [2/9/2022 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qoB5B8sSsq1wGVAwKsJnru8UTU0f1s4mj-mzEL92ggw/edit?usp=sharing)

We have an interesting event coming up later this week:
