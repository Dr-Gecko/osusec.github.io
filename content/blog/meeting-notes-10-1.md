Thank you to everyone for coming to our first meeting this year! We had well over our expected 70 people in attendance. We introduced OSUSEC, what we do, how our Discord server works, as well as some ethics. We introduced members to Capture The Flag, and we delved into the first CTF League challenge of the year, a web challenge!

Here are the slides (requires ONID login): [Google Slides for 10/1/2021](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OjRPWjH5fJ_sqT3w95dpaNR2Op83YE-4eJWjg0TYdXQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Next week we have two meetings:

- General club meeting for Introduction to Lockpicking: Wednesday 10/6/2021 @ 6:00PM in LINC 307. Here we will have various locks to try to pick open, starting with easy locks, and moving to harder ones.
- CTF League meeting: Friday 10/8/2021 @ 6:00PM in KEC 1003/1005/1007. This meeting will present the next challenge for CTF League. We aim to have the team distribution process streamlined.
