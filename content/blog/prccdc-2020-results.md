Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the in-person Pacific Rim Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (PRCCDC) was unfortunately cancelled. However, PRCCDC, working in combination with NCCDC, allowed all of the Pacific Rim teams to compete in the National Wildcard Event, which was held online on April 11th, 2020.

**I am pleased to announce that OSUSEC placed 2nd in the PRCCDC division (out of 12 teams), and 9th overall (out of 26 teams)!** It was a 4 hour event where teams secured 8 machines (4 Windows and 4 Linux) for a variety of security and policy issues.

Here is the team for this event

- Ryan Kennedy (captain)
- Zander Work
- Lyell Read
- Gabriel Kulp
- Michael Jereza
- Andrew Dassonville
- Phillip Mestas
- Stan Lyakhov

Congrats to the team!
