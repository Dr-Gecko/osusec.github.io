Howdy Hackers! This Friday, a group of OSUSEC members took a day trip up to Portland to attend BSidesPDX 2022 and compete in their CTF. We had an absolute blast, winning first place in the CTF, attending many interesting talks, and making some new friends! We became known as the team competing in the closet, as the CTF team set up fort in a nearby maintenance closet instead of the official CTF room. For our win, the club won a Flipper Zero and bragging rights üôÇ

Many thanks to the BSidesPDX crew for hosting another great year! The passion and hard work they bring to organizing the event is evident, and a treat every year.
