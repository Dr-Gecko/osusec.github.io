Tonight I gave a tutorial on IDA Pro basics, and how to get started with this awesome tool. I also released some new binaries on the CTF site for you to practice IDA.

Remember, as a OSU Security Club member you have access to our lab systems, which has the full version of IDA Pro and the Hex-Rays Decompiler installed, so make sure to use those if you want to take advantage of the advanced functionality.
