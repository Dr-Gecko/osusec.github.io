Thank you to everyone who attended tonight’s meeting! We chatted about reverse engineering and binary exploitation (pwn) tools and how to use them, and I demonstrated how to solve the `rev01` challenge on the CTF Practice Range at [https://ctf.osusec.org](https://ctf.osusec.org/).

The slides for the meeting are available here (ONID Login Required): [2/2/2022 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15-nChPrarLVvg2oKLMy3KXsMSwEjvnWC63rMxWKX9iI/edit?usp=sharing)

There are some interesting upcoming events which all club members are welcome at:

- **CTF League: This Friday, 6:00pm – 8:00pm** (and every Friday during the term), we will have an awesome, real-world challenge for you to solve. **This meeting will be remote**, and take place on Discord. For more information, check out: [https://www.osusec.org/ctf-league/](https://www.osusec.org/ctf-league/)
- **This weekend we will compete in DiceCTF 2022.** Add the CTF role to play using `!role add ctf` in the #botspam channel and come check out the challenges! There should be a wealth of challenges of all levels, so there’s something for everyone to solve. **We will meet remotely over Discord** in the voice chats for CTF.
