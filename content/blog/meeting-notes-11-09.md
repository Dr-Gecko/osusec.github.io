Howdy hackers! Last night, I covered cybersecurity in software development. I talked about how you can incorporate security into each stage of the Software Development Lifecycle, some examples of how that has gone wrong in real life software projects, and the different mitigations that have come about in an effort to control memory corruption attacks (an example of improper input handling).

The slides for the meeting are available here (ONID required): [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lFwF22hw8KivDTW0r4knwspKNSqMVIiPQYHLL5arzxI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lFwF22hw8KivDTW0r4knwspKNSqMVIiPQYHLL5arzxI/edit?usp=sharing)
