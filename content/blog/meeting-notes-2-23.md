Thank you to everyone who attended tonight’s meeting! We introduced several different CTF categories and what challenges usually look like within those categories. Then, we went over some of the challenges on the CTF Practice Range at [https://ctf.osusec.org](https://ctf.osusec.org/).

The slides for the meeting are available here (ONID Login Required): [2/23/2022 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J6M9TqSjz6SHVKk_BBUPANaz1Q2LeKgHYCcUcOb15M0/edit?usp=sharing)
