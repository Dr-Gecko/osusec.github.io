The Cyberforce Competition (formerly known as the Department of Energy Cyber Defense Competition) is coming up in a couple months, and it’s time to start getting ready!

If you are interested in being on the team for this competition, please fill out the form here by October 10th.

Requirements for applying:

- You will be able to spend time during October and November preparing for the competition by completing a variety of tasks
- You are able to travel to Washington or California to compete in the competition on November 30th and December 1st
    - We will probably be leaving the night of the 29th

Even if you think you might not be qualified enough, I’d still wholly encourage you to apply. This competition was an awesome experience last year, and I’m sure it’ll be even better this year!
