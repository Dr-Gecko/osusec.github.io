Today we continued discussing reverse engineering and introduced 64-bit assembly. There are more samples on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/osusec/intro-rev).

The only announcement for today is to RSVP for our upcoming event with NetSPI! They will be coming back on 2/21 to do a presentation on penetration testing, and answer any questions you may have. The RSVP is just so I can get a head count for pizza. [RSVP here](https://goo.gl/forms/eFVIgj533f3DEzP52)

There are new challenges up on CTFd, rev\[1-3]-64.
