Thanks to Kees Cook for an awesome look at kernel security! Kees talked about how the kernel exploit for CVE-2017-7038 was discovered, which allowed privilege escalation due to a heap overflow.

You can see his slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T4pHribl-TFyw02ho7goFhVGfSzXkqXB/view?usp=sharing), which also has information for building the POC images for the exploit.

This was our last meeting for Winter 2019, so Iâ€™ll see you all next term! Our first meeting will be on Week 2.
