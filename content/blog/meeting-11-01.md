Thanks to Karl Fosaaen from NetSPI for the awesome presentation on an introduction to penetration testing! Remember, if you want to learn about these things on your own, please make sure to do it on your own network and devices. I’ll update this post with a link to the slides when they become available.

I don’t have any announcements for this week, so I’ll see you all next week!
