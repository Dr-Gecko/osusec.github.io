Thank you to all the members that attended this meeting! We covered lockpicking basics, legality and ethics, before Ryan presented a live demonstration of picking a lock. Then, each table had a selection of locks of increasing difficulty and tools to try to pick them with.

Here are the slides (requires ONID login): [Google Slides for 10/6/2021](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CIVLa1oaAJ-bhY2KlMOVRJiNcoI3ZaAFEXmLoR4-t5g/edit?usp=sharing)

Next week (week of 10/11) we have two meetings:

- Talk by NetSPI about NetSPI U on Wednesday 10/13/2021 @ 6:00pm – 7:00pm. This will be a Virtual talk, the zoom link will be posted in the OSUSEC Discord.
- CTF League on Friday 10/15/2021 @ 6:00pm – 8:00pm in KEC 1003. We will be having pizza outside the room first (likely outside or in the atrium – see the CTF League Discord), followed by breaking up into teams by team number just as we did last Friday.
