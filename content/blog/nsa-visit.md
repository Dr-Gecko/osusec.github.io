Yesterday the National Security Agency came to meet with some members of the university and give a talk to the OSU Security Club. The visit was a great success and we had over 100 people in attendance for the talk.

The talk was focused around the [NSA Codebreaker Challenge](https://codebreaker.ltsnet.net/home), which just started last weekend (Oregon State won last year, and is currently in 2nd place). There was also a long Q&A session following the talk, where club members were able to ask questions about the challenge, in addition to general curiosities about the National Security Agency. The slides for the talk are available [here](https://codebreaker.ltsnet.net/files/downloads/resource_files/CBCTechTalk2019.pdf).

Members of the [SSH Lab](https://ssh.unexploitable.systems/) at Oregon State were able to meet with the NSA representatives earlier in the day and talk about some of their ongoing research, amongst other topics (pictured above).

Thanks to the National Security Agency for coming out to Oregon State, and we hope to see you again in the future!
