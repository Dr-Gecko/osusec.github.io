Howdy hackers! Thanks to everyone who showed up, and we hope it was enjoyable and informative! Tonight we introduced Cyber Defense Competitions. We covered some of the skills and areas you would learn by playing in a CDC, what makes them fun, and the career advantages of getting involved in them!

The slides for the meeting are available here: [https://www.osusec.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-10-05-Intro-to-CDC.html]https://www.osusec.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-10-05-Intro-to-CDC.html
