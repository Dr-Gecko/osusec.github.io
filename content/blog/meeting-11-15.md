Thanks for a great last meeting for the Fall term!

I gave a talk on all of the low-level architecture and x86 assembly content needed to get started with binary pwning, [here is a link to the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ys0tQNGGLpcJlUu3Zkp9V5IyZXo8Cfl7DPv_HWl1xFs/edit?usp=sharing). Hopefully, this is enough to get you all started!

Have a great winter break!
