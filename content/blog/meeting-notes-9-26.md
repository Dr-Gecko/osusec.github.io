Thanks everyone for coming out to our first meeting! We had over 50 people in attendance, and introduced the OSU Security Club, what we do, what we stand for, our plans for the year, and worked on a couple introductory CTF challenges.

Here is a link to the slides (requires ONID login): [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oCiwxyT840GtcusgTdD55UB-BlvP2BcfjeDDj3vDDew/edit?usp=sharing)

Next week we have two meetings:

- The first CTF meeting is Tuesday, 10/1 @ 6:30pm in KEC 1005. We will be going over our standard tool/VM configuration, and go through some challenges from the CSAW qualifiers
- The next general meeting is Thursday, 10/3 @ 7pm in KEC 1003. We will be showing some cool tools that you can use to solve Tasks 1-3 of the Codebreaker Challenge.
