Today we hosted Ryan Gurr and Alex Ryan from Fidelis Cybersecurity, who talked about their experiences and background in information security, and showed a cool demo of Fidelis’s platform.

If you have any questions for Ryan or Alex, please contact them, they said they’d love to answer any questions you may have, related to Fidelis or not. You can get their contact info [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18g0qBozZOs1t-4D8voU4hFAk0hByz5URLihxD19rRUM/edit?usp=sharing).
