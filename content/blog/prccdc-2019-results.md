This past weekend, OSUSEC competed at the Pacific Rim Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (PRCCDC) hosted by Highline College. I’m pleased to announce that we placed 3rd out of 13 teams in this tough competition.

PRCCDC is a 2 day competition where each team must secure a mix of approximately 10 Windows and Linux systems, configure a border firewall, monitor and defend against attacks from the Red Team, and work with business users over the phone throughout the event.
