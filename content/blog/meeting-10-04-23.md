Howdy hackers!

Thanks for showing up last night, and staying flexible with us! I know we weren't able to host the meeting we wanted at the last minute, but hopefully you got to enjoy some memes, learn about the club, and possibly pick a lock for the first time! We hope to see you again in more meetings throughout the term. Please feel free to reach out to any officer if you have questions or need help!

Watch out for next week's meeting, where one of our members will be presenting on how he used his pwn skills in order to set a SuperMetroid speedrun record!
