Thank you to everyone who attended! This meeting covered an introduction to reverse engineering on x86 64-bit. We covered some key differences between x86 and x86-64, then we examined how typical control flows are compiled to assembly based on the C source code.

Here are the slides (requires ONID login): [Google Slides for 1/26/2021](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15X3pdIcGWrU92HM59QuKUdE9rw-ED12k_vQOIxARDE4/edit?usp=sharing)

The binary and C code that we looked at during tonight’s talk are [posted on GitHub](https://github.com/osusec/intro-rev).

The next meetings are as follows:

- **CTF League on Friday 1/28/2021 @ 6:00pm – 8:00pm, virtually** (on Discord).
- **OSUSEC General Meeting on 2/2/2022 @ 6:00pm, virtually** (on Discord). We will interactively work on a simple reverse engineering challenge on the OSUSEC CTF practice range.
