Prompt This time we have a username. Can you track down NahamConTron?
Solution I used the namechk tools from the OSINT Framework Site. Specifically, I used OSINT Framework &amp;gt; Username &amp;gt; Username Search Engines &amp;gt; Namechk, similarly to in AUCTF.
namechk tells me that there are claimed usernames for the name NahamConTron for many sites, including Instagram.
Checking out the Instagram account, we get the flag.

Prompt We have to use Microsoft Word at the office!? Oof…
Download the file below.
File
Solution Opening the file does not do much, but it would not be that easy.
Using file we can find out that this is an OOXML document:
$ file microsooft.docx microsooft.docx: Microsoft OOXML Based on this, and some quick reading, we can see that this format can contain files. To view these files, I first tried this chrome extension, before settling on getting a trial licensed version of OxygenXML.</description></item><item><title>NahamConCTF - Time Keeper</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/nahamconctf-time-keeper/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/nahamconctf-time-keeper/</guid><description>50 points
Prompt There is some interesting stuff on this website. Or at least, I thought there was…
Connect here: https://apporima.com/
Note, this flag is not in the usual format.
Solution After scoping out that site, the title and description heavily hint towards use of the Wayback Machine. Over there we head, then.
First, I noted that there were only two captures, so I figured it would be worth it to compare them.</description></item><item><title>NahamConCTF - Tron</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/nahamconctf-tron/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/nahamconctf-tron/</guid><description>75 points
Prompt NahamConTron is up to more shenanigans. Find his server.
Solution I used the namechk tools from the OSINT Framework Site. Specifically, I used OSINT Framework &amp;gt; Username &amp;gt; Username Search Engines &amp;gt; Namechk, similarly to in AUCTF.
namechk tells me that there are claimed usernames for the name NahamConTron for many sites:
Now that we have exhausted Instagram, I opened up all the other sites with claimed usernames for NahamConTron and systematically eliminated them.</description></item><item><title>NahamConCTF - Fake File</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/nahamconctf-fake-file/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/nahamconctf-fake-file/</guid><description>100 points
