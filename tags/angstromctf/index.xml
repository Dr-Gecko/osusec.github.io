Hint: Are you sure that’s an mp4 file? What’s inside the file?
Solution First, we deduced some information about the challenge by reading the description. “The flag is all lowercase” implies that we will be constructing it letter by letter, possibly from audio.</description></item><item><title>ångstromCTF lithp</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/angstromctf-lithp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/angstromctf-lithp/</guid><description>Problem My friend gave me this program but I couldn’t understand what he was saying – what was he trying to tell me?

Solution First things first, let’s open that lisp program . . . It actually is lisp… oh god what have I just gotten into?
The first lines were most important in solving this challenge the way I did it. It reads:
(defparameter *encrypted* &amp;#39;(8930 15006 8930 10302 11772 13806 13340 11556 12432 13340 10712 10100 11556 12432 9312 10712 10100 10100 8930 10920 8930 5256 9312 9702 8930 10712 15500 9312)) (defparameter *flag* &amp;#39;(redacted)) (defparameter *reorder* &amp;#39;(19 4 14 3 10 17 24 22 8 2 5 11 7 26 0 25 18 6 21 23 9 13 16 1 12 15 27 20)) Well, then.</description></item></channel></rss>
