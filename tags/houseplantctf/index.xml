Solution This provided archive contains 90,000 JPEG‚Äôs. I extracted all of them to ./images (relative to this README‚Äôs PWD). Each of these images has a size of 1 pixel.
Then, comes the fun part. Before reading the hint, I tried just forming the image from the pixels in the order that they appeared in the folder, but this revealed a ‚Äòstatic‚Äô image.</description></item></channel></rss>
